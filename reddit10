This is basically the problem in any government. Everybody outside of the capital city always hates the capital city, yet they also want the capital city to send them all the money, no matter how much more it is than what they put in. Usually also the larger areas are underrepresented in the democratic system, so that the smaller ones are drowned out. All problems are blamed on the big city or big province, etc., yet everyone always looks to them for solutions or support.
I think it will never change, because it's true on all levels of politics.

There is a pretty strong group within EU made up of Poland, the Scandinavian member states and the Baltics that have risen up after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They have deepend security ties and met barely a week ago in Sweden. They all have in common that they take the threat from Russia seriously and see a strong EU as a necessity. I think they should take the lead and have the rest of Europe follow their example.

Yes I am with you on that. I really hope they will Europe in the years to come. As a german I am majorly annoyed by the german government with their hesistant bullshit politics regarding russian aggression. Germany is way to comfortable and on top of that imbued by russian propaganda to take the necessary steps leading to a strong EU/NATO.

During these times we don't need the careful economy-focused leadership that Germany or France could provide, but one that focusing on actually defending the continent against potential and not-so-potential aggressors.

Maybe this vacuum of leadership in the absence of traditionally leading countries could be the push towards a union that is lead not by the will of countries but by the will of the union itself? Maybe a bit of wishfull thinking, and it would certainly need some reforms of how EU is governed and how our leaders are chosen

For over a decade Germany pushed for the democratisation of the EU to make the EU less reliant on a German or French voice, this was all torpedoed by other member countries.
It was essentially a German goal to make Germany not lead the Union.

More and more countries will be facing this impasse, given that 20-30% of the voter base want to burn the post WW2 system to the ground (by voting far-right parties who want to undo Western liberal democracy), which renders government coalitions very difficult - unless they are GroKo big tent of most non far right parties.
It's a result of the way people vote with anger rather than logic lately

No power hegemony, so we're forced to govern according to democratic principles? Oh, the humanity!

it's a shame most commenters instant reaction is "Country X will step up!" The EU is a union. The European parliament needs to take on it's role as the overlord of all it's memberstates, and make sure they behave and cooperate better.

ðŸ‡µðŸ‡± Poland to Lead the Way. ðŸ¦… Poland assumes the EU Presidency Shortly. Being a key partner in the war that Ukraine is Facing, it is only natural and right that Poland provide the necessary leadership at this time. Poland is ready, and able to assume this role

the EU don't even have any interest in sovereignty we can't expect a federal rulership
we could start talking about federal energy, internet provider, military industry, internet service such as social media, science research etc etc
but we don't as individual nation interest matter more than the whole union interest, the sole concept of unrestricted free market between the EU, USA and China ruin any sovereignty attempt and because we don't have any natural ressource we remain dependant on those unless we become an imperialist entity and yet no one want that except Russia and China we passively watch
i'm French and i wouldn't mind if any other european state take the federal rulership yet no one seem to want it, we French don't want it and no one want us to have it either, any attempt to a federal rulership would end up into an attempt to ruin other country to the ruler sole benefit and that's extreamly sad considering it's our only hope to remain meaningfull in the future
