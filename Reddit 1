This is basically the problem in any government. Everybody outside of the capital city always hates the capital city, yet they also want the capital city to send them all the money, no matter how much more it is than what they put in. Usually also the larger areas are underrepresented in the democratic system, so that the smaller ones are drowned out. All problems are blamed on the big city or big province, etc., yet everyone always looks to them for solutions or support. I think it will never change, because it's true on all levels of politics.
