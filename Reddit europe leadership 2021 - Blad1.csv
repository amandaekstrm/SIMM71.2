2021," I mean this is a very hard task because there are several nations that are anti-EU integration or pro-status quo and against any proposal that goes towards federalising the EU or too far.
Doesnt matter who sits in charge of the EC at that point, it could very well be the most liked Swede but Sweden would still not just switch sides to wanting to expand the so called federal project.
You'd have to find a magician at this point to find someone that can expand the so called federal project in any meaningful way in the 5 year long term they have.
It's more of a timing thing with what's happening at the time honestly. Gotta have the right person at the right time more or less. You could find the best person for the job but if nothing happens during their term that can be used to drive this project not a whole lot will be done."
2021,"a want a truly elected leader of the EU, f the Commission, make the parliament the voice of democratic power in the EU"
2021,"Von der Leyen doesn't have a whole lot of power. The governments of the member states decide what direction the EU takes.
The only thing that was news-worthy was the European Army, which really isn't the top priority right now?
It had better become a priority or the Russian Army will be holding a Victory Parade on the Champs Elysee on of these days."
2021,"If r/Europe or this sub is in any way representative of Germany, which I doubt, they hate her.

I find von Der Leyen unlikable, and I find cringy the appreciation posts that sometimes crop up about her on r/Europe. But unless you can prove gross negligence I doubt you could or should replace her. She is boring, uninspiring and probably corrupt, but that is true for huge section of politicians everywhere. I don't think her performance on the vaccines was as bad as you make it out to be, but I'm willing to hear counterpoints, but even if that was the case deposing her would shed a bad light on a situation that is just now starting to be perceived well.

I think rather than focusing on deposing Von der Leyen you should be focusing on the reasons that made her rise to power and nomination even possible in the first place and how to make sure a better candidate wins next time. It's entirely normal in any political entity of any kind to go through bad politicians.

Also can you further explain your 2 last points?"
2021,The president needs a bigger mandate in any situation. The reason von der leyen is disliked is partly due to the lack of mandate
