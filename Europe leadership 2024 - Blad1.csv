2024,"This is basically the problem in any government. Everybody outside of the capital city always hates the capital city, yet they also want the capital city to send them all the money, no matter how much more it is than what they put in. Usually also the larger areas are underrepresented in the democratic system, so that the smaller ones are drowned out. All problems are blamed on the big city or big province, etc., yet everyone always looks to them for solutions or support.
I think it will never change, because it's true on all levels of politics."
2024,"There is a pretty strong group within EU made up of Poland, the Scandinavian member states and the Baltics that have risen up after Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They have deepend security ties and met barely a week ago in Sweden. They all have in common that they take the threat from Russia seriously and see a strong EU as a necessity. I think they should take the lead and have the rest of Europe follow their example."
2024,Yes I am with you on that. I really hope they will Europe in the years to come. As a german I am majorly annoyed by the german government with their hesistant bullshit politics regarding russian aggression. Germany is way to comfortable and on top of that imbued by russian propaganda to take the necessary steps leading to a strong EU/NATO.
2024,"During these times we don't need the careful economy-focused leadership that Germany or France could provide, but one that focusing on actually defending the continent against potential and not-so-potential aggressors."
2024,"Maybe this vacuum of leadership in the absence of traditionally leading countries could be the push towards a union that is lead not by the will of countries but by the will of the union itself? Maybe a bit of wishfull thinking, and it would certainly need some reforms of how EU is governed and how our leaders are chosen"
